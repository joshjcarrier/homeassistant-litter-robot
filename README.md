# Litter-Robot

The `litter-robot` component offers integration with the [Litter-Robot](https://www.litter-robot.com/litter-robot-iii-open-air-with-connect.html) WiFi enabled devices to [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

> 🍻 I'm not employed by Litter Robot, and provide this plugin purely for our own enjoyment.
>
> Use [my referal code](http://share.litter-robot.com/rmc2b) and get \$25 off your own robot (and it tips me too!)

## Install

Load this component by copying the entire directory as described in https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/creating_component_loading.html . This is easiest with the Samba share add-on.

## Setup

You'll need to have connected to your robot at least once before with the mobile app.

### Configuration

Edit `/config/configuration.yaml`. For a robot nicknamed "Tesla Meowdel S":

```yaml
litter_robot:
  username: "<your litter-robot open connect email>"
  password: "<your litter-robot password>"
  scan_interval: 120

switch:
  - platform: template
    switches:
      litter_robot_nightlight:
        friendly_name: "Tesla Meowdel S Night Light"
        value_template: "{{ is_state('sensor.litter_robot_tesla_meowdel_s_nightlight', 'On') }}"
        icon_template: "mdi:lightbulb"
        turn_on:
          service: litter_robot.nightlight_turn_on
        turn_off:
          service: litter_robot.nightlight_turn_off
      litter_robot_cycle:
        friendly_name: "Tesla Meowdel S Cycle"
        value_template: "{{ is_state('sensor.litter_robot_tesla_meowdel_s_status', 'Clean Cycling') }}"
        icon_template: "mdi:refresh"
        turn_on:
          service: litter_robot.cycle
        turn_off:
```

### Finishing setup

Restart HASS to activate the component and to reapply config changes. This can be done from the frontend via Configuration -> General -> Server management -> Restart.

### Troubleshooting

If there's a problem, the new `sensor.litter_robot_*` won't appear. This is most likely invalid configuration (see above) or a Litter Robot username/password problem. Details will be logged in the Developer Tools -> Logs section.

**Password issues:** It's been reported that resetting your Litter Robot account password might help if your password isn't being accepted, so make sure you try updating your mobile app to the latest version and resetting the password!

## Grouping Sensors

Discover the list by searching "litter_robot" in the frontend: Developer tools -> <> (States).

Edit `/config/groups.yaml`. For a robot nicknamed "Tesla Meowdel S":

```yaml
Tesla Meowdel S:
  control: hidden
  entities:
    - sensor.litter_robot_tesla_meowdel_s_status
    - sensor.litter_robot_tesla_meowdel_s_waste
    - switch.litter_robot_cycle
    - switch.litter_robot_nightlight
```

Then reload Groups config. This is easiest done with the frontend Configuration -> General -> Configuration reloading -> Reload groups.

## Multiple robots

The sensors will automatically provision themselves, but to control individual robots you'll need to specify a `data` section in the service call. The `litter_robot_id` should match the Litter Robot API ID and can be found in the Developer Tools -> States tab for the `litter_robot_..._status` sensor.

```yml
turn_on:
  service: litter_robot.nightlight_turn_on
  data:
    litter_robot_id: a00bb111cccca
```

## Development

Watch `/config/home-assistant.log`, which is accessible from the frontend via Developer tools -> (i) (/developer-tools/logs).
